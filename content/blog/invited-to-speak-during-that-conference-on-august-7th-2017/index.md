Do you have plans this August? Come [join me at That Conference](https://www.thatconference.com/speakers/speaker/gruberchris) on August 7th, 2017! I will be attending this casual and family friendly event for software developers.

I will be [speaking about JSON web tokens and Auth0](https://www.thatconference.com/Sessions/Session/11105). I will explain what a JSON web token is and how to use them for projects of all sizes and complexity. I will also explain some of the things I have learned along the way as I deployed solutions and how I troubleshoot problems.

If you are attending [That Conference](https://www.thatconference.com), please stop by and see my presentation!
