# Rebooted: My Journey With Software & Technology

This is my blog website hosted and distributed by CDN by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [React](https://www.reactjs.org). I used the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog#readme) as a starter template and I continue to customize my website from there.
